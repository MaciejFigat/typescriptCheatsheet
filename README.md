***Typescript cheatsheet***
This is react app typescript minidocumentation I made in purpose of learning and ease of access during development of future TS projects. I have used resources from several sources especially
[this mega cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react/blob/main/README.md#basic-cheatsheet-table-of-contents)
[this advanced version too](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react).
I have utilized [official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [typescript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).

***Main focus of this project***
- Hooks in React
- Props 

***Packages used***
  - react-bootstrap
  - bootstrap5
  - react-syntax-highlighter - this is used to present the code and all the snippets I introduce.
